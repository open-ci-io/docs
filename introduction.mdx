## Prerequisites

To self-host OpenCI, you need to meet the following requirements:

- Mac with M1 chip or later
- macOS 14.0 or later

## Initial Setup

Several tools need to be installed to self-host OpenCI.

### Tart

Tart is a tool for managing macOS VMs.

<CodeGroup>

  ```bash macOS
  brew install tart
  ```

</CodeGroup>

### Firebase CLI

OpenCI uses Firebase, so Firebase CLI installation is required.

<CodeGroup>

  ```bash macOS
  curl -sL https://firebase.tools | bash
  ```

</CodeGroup>

### OpenCI Runner

OpenCI Runner is a CLI for running OpenCI. Dart is required for installation.

<CodeGroup>

  ```bash macOS
  dart pub global activate openci_runner
  ```

  ```bash install Dart
  brew install dart-sdk
  ```

</CodeGroup>

### Download Base Image

OpenCI uses macOS 15.0 as its base image. This process takes considerable time.

<CodeGroup>

  ```bash macOS
# Login to GitHub Container Registry
echo -n ${github_acceess_token} | \
tart login ghcr.io \
  --username ${username} \
  --password-stdin

# Pull base image
tart pull ghcr.io/${org-name}/${image-name}
  ```

</CodeGroup>

## Firebase Setup
OpenCI uses Firebase for its backend services. Therefore, Firebase configuration is necessary.

### Create Firebase Project

Access the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) with your Google account and create a project.

### Firestore Setup

Firestore is used for build job registration. Please access Firestore and complete the provisioning process.

### Firebase Functions Setup
OpenCI uses Firebase Functions. Firebase Functions requires registration for the Blaze plan (paid). The cost is typically a few dollars per month.

### Deploy Firebase Functions
Clone the OpenCI repository.
<CodeGroup>

  ```bash macOS
  gh repo clone open-ci-io/openci
  ```

</CodeGroup>

Then, navigate to the firebase_functions directory and run the following command to deploy Firebase Functions:

<CodeGroup>

  ```bash macOS
  cd apps/firebase_functions/functions
  firebase deploy --only functions
  ```

</CodeGroup>
